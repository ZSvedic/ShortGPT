Note that unlike in traditional machine translation,\n\nthe alignment is not considered to be a latent variable. Instead, the alignment model directly computes a soft alignment, which allows the gradient of the cost function to be backpropagated through.\nThis gradient can be used to train the alignment model as well as the whole translation model jointly.\nWe can understand the approach of taking a weighted sum of all the annotations as computing an\nexpected annotation, where the expectation is over possible alignments. Let \u03b1ij be a probability that the target word is aligned to, or translated from, a source word xj . Then, the i-th context vector\nis the expected annotation over all the annotations with probabilities \u03b1ij .The probability \u03b1ij , or its associated energy eij , reflects the importance of the annotation hj with\nrespect to the previous hidden state si\u22121 in deciding the next state si and generating yi\n. Intuitively, this implements a mechanism of attention in the decoder. The decoder decides parts of the source sentence to pay attention to. By letting the decoder have an attention mechanism, we relieve the encoder from the burden of having to encode all information in the source sentence into a fixedlength vector.

Developments there, on the other hand, are contributing to tighter credit conditions and are likely to weigh on economic growth, hiring and inflation,\u201d he said as part of a panel on monetary policy.\n\n\u201cSo as a result, our policy rate may not need to rise as much as it would have otherwise to achieve our goals,\u201d he added. \u201cOf course, the extent of that is highly uncertain.\u201d\n\nPowell spoke with markets mostly expecting the Fed at its June meeting to take a break from the series of rate hikes it began in March 2022. However, pricing has been volatile as Fed officials weigh the impact that policy has had and will have on inflation that in the summer of last year was running at a 41-year high.\n\nOn balance, Powell said inflation is still too high.\n\n\u201cMany people are currently experiencing high inflation, for the first time in their lives. It\u2019s not a headline to say that they really don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said during a forum that also featured former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke.\n\n\u201cWe think that failure to get inflation down would, would not only prolong the pain but also increase ultimately the social costs of getting back to price stability, causing even greater harm to families and businesses, and we aim to avoid that by remaining steadfast in pursuit of our goals,\u201d he added.\n\nPowell characterized current Fed policy as \u201crestrictive\u201d and said future decisions would be data-dependent as opposed to being a preset course. The Federal Open Market Committee has raised its benchmark borrowing rate to a target of 5%-5.25% from near zero where it had sat since the early days of the Covid pandemic.\n\nOfficials have stressed that rate hikes operate with a lag of a year or more, so the policy moves have not completely circulated through the economy.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any decisions about the extent to which additional policy funding will be appropriate.

In the 1940s, India had approximately 350 million Hindus and about 100 million Muslims. As they intensified their struggle against the British, Indians also struggled with each other. This was a direct result of Britain\u2019s Divide and Rule policies. \n\nThe Indian National Congress Party was India\u2019s national political party. Most members of the Congress were Hindus, but the party at times had many Muslim members. In competition with the Congress Party was the Muslim League, an organization founded in 1906 in India to protect Muslim interests.  Members of the league felt that the mainly Hindu Congress Party looked out primarily for Hindu interests. The British government encouraged the creation of the Muslim League in hope of keeping India from being united in their fight for independence.\n\nThe leader of the Muslim League, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, insisted that all Muslims resign from the Congress Party.  The Muslim League stated that it would never accept Indian independence if it meant rule by the Hindu-dominated Congress Party.  Instead they wanted a separate nation for Muslims.

We perform our\nanalysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded\nincluding a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the\nchannel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter\nspace at the CNGS beam is $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$. The reason for that is\ntwofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation\nis the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for\nwhich both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an\nextremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\\nu_\\mu\n\\to \\nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile\nneutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is\nsignificantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.\nData from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the\nfour-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of\n$\\Dmq_\\Sbl \\gtrsim 0.1 \\eVq$, \\textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this\nmass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on\n$\\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible\nexistence of sterile neutrinos.\n\""},{"from":"gpt","value":"CNGS beam, sterile neutrino, OPERA detector, ICARUS detector, $\\nu_\\mu \\to \\nu_\\tau$, nominal intensity, neutrino flux"}]},{"id":"ffbf80ac78034b46bde2b366157c0db6","conversations":[{"from":"human","value":"How do you know whether an idea is good to research or not?"},{"from":"gpt","value":"Original, relevant, feasible.

It is clear from his writing that Clifford intended his algebra to\ndescribe the geometric properties of vectors, planes and higher-dimensional objects.\nBut most physicists first encounter the algebra in the guise of the Pauli\nand Dirac matrix algebras of quantum theory. Few then contemplate using these\nunwieldy matrices for practical geometric computing. Indeed, some physicists\ncome away from a study of Dirac theory with the view that Clifford\u2019s algebra\nis inherently quantum-mechanical. In this book we aim to dispel this belief by\ngiving a straightforward introduction to this new and fundamentally different\napproach to vectors and vector multiplication.

Its bell usually reaches about 16 cm in diameter but can grow up to 35 cm. From each of the four corners of the bell trails a cluster of 15 tentacles. The pale blue bell has faint markings; viewed from certain angles, it bears a somewhat eerie resemblance to a human head or skull. Since it is virtually transparent, the creature is nearly impossible to see in its habitat, posing significant danger to swimmers.\nWhen the jellyfish are swimming, the tentacles contract so they are about 150 mm (5.9 in) long and about 5 mm (0.20 in) in diameter; when they are hunting, the tentacles are thinner and extend to about 3 m (9.8 ft) long. The tentacles are covered with a high concentration of stinging cells called cnidocytes, which are activated by pressure and a chemical trigger; they react to proteinous chemicals. Box jellyfish are day hunters; at night they are seen resting on the ocean floor.\nIn common with other box jellyfish, C. fleckeri has four eye-clusters with 24 eyes. Some of these eyes seem capable of forming images, but whether they exhibit any object recognition or object tracking is debated; it is also unknown how they process information from their sense of touch and eye-like light-detecting structures due to their lack of a central nervous system. They are attracted to light of different colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue), but blue light seems to elicit a feeding behavior, as it slows down their pulsation rate and makes them stream out their tentacles. Black objects, on the other hand, cause them to move away.\nChironex fleckeri lives on a diet of prawns and small fish and are prey to turtles, whose thick skin is impenetrable to the cnidocytes of the jellyfish."},{"from":"gpt","value":"- Largest box jellyfish, up to 35 cm bell  \n- Tentacles stretch 3 m when hunting  \n- Invisible underwater, dangerous  \n- 24 eyes, no central"}]},{"id":"95c2763cca0b484e832887ae2fe0f78f","conversations":[{"from":"human","value":"What Chemicals are in Aspirin?"},{"from":"gpt","value":"Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), C9H8O4"}]},{"id":"9e0d51a3c301470fad1321185d64d94d","conversations":[{"from":"human","value":"I am running the adventure \"Rotblack Sludge\" for the game MORK BORG.

Within the classes, students will engage with step-by-step lessons that cover the class content.

In smokers with metabolic disorders, CS cessation decreases the risks of serious pulmonary events, inflammation, and metabolic disorder. This review included recent studies examining the mechanisms underlying the effects of CS and PM on gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic disorder development; one of the potential mechanisms is the disruption of the lung-gut axis, leading to gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and metabolic disease. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the primary metabolites of gut bacteria, which are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. They activate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, suppress histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, and inhibit inflammation, facilitating the maintenance of gut health and biofunction. The aforementioned gut microbiota dysbiosis reduces SCFA levels. Treatment targeting SCFA\/GPCR signaling may alleviate air pollution-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders, which involve lung-gut axis disruption."},{"from":"gpt","value":"- Cigarette smoking\n- Particulate matter\n- Metabolic disorders\n- Insulin resistance\n- Hyperglycemia\n- Diabetes mellitus\n- Dysbiosis\n-"}]},{"id":"e87c50a572d84acf820e6d61f5998494","conversations":[{"from":"human","value":"Write a song in the stile of Ed Sheeran called \"Curtains\""},{"from":"gpt","value":"Behind curtains, love won't fade."}]},{"id":"4d7d1eea3a604afbbe445d50de54918e","conversations":[{"from":"human","value":"What should I plant in my kitchen garden?

In classical computers, information is stored and processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. However, in quantum computers, information is stored and processed using quantum bits, or qubits.\n\nWhat makes qubits special is that they can exist in multiple states at the same time. While a classical bit can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This is known as superposition. It's like having a coin that can be heads and tails at the same time.\n\nAnother important property of qubits is entanglement. When qubits are entangled, the state of one qubit becomes connected to the state of another qubit, no matter how far apart they are. This means that changing the state of one qubit will instantly affect the state of the other qubit, even if they are separated by vast distances.\n\nThese unique properties of qubits enable quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. Quantum computers can solve complex problems that would take classical computers a very long time or be practically impossible. They have the potential to revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, drug discovery, and material science.\n\nHowever, quantum computing is still in its early stages, and building practical, error-free quantum computers is a significant challenge.
