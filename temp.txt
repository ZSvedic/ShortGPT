--------------------------- ChatGPT suggestions:
It looks like the significant variations in execution times are due to the differences in the **padded input length** and **output lengths**. As you suspected, padding could be inflating the input sequences to the length of the longest sequence in the batch, which results in much larger inputs and outputs, especially in cases with unusually long sequences.

### Key Observations:
1. **Padded Input Lengths**: The input lengths vary significantly across different chunks, sometimes going as high as 1131 tokens.
2. **Output Lengths**: Similarly, output lengths vary widely, with some outputs as long as 1230 tokens.
3. **Time Spikes**: The large padded input and output lengths directly correlate with the increased total processing time for some chunks.

### Potential Solutions:
1. **Reduce Padding Impact**:
   - **Dynamic Batching**: Sort the sequences by length before batching, so that you minimize the amount of padding required in each batch. You can then group sequences of similar lengths together, which will reduce padding overhead and speed up processing.
   
   Here's an example approach for sorting by input length before batching:
   ```python
   sorted_messages = sorted(messages, key=lambda x: len(tokenizer.encode(x['content'])))
   ```

2. **Use Smaller Max Length**: If feasible, limit the maximum input and output lengths (`max_new_tokens`) to avoid inflating sequence sizes. This ensures that very long sequences are truncated or handled separately.
   ```python
   outputs_tokens = model.generate(
       inputs_tokenized, attention_mask=inputs_att_mask, 
       max_new_tokens=min(max_new_tok, 512),  # Adjust this to a reasonable limit
       pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)
   ```

3. **Batch by Input and Output Length**: You can also batch based on both input and expected output lengths to prevent large outputs from slowing down the entire batch.

4. **Profile Long Sequences Separately**: Identify particularly long inputs or outputs and process them in separate batches with a different chunk size to avoid them from affecting the average processing time of the whole batch.

By applying these techniques, you should be able to control the variability in chunk processing times.
