It marked a significant turning point in history; almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. The revolution began with the mechanization of the textile industry, followed by the development of iron-making techniques, and the increased use of refined coal.\n",

The steam engine, developed by James Watt, became a key source of power for factories and transportation.\n",
